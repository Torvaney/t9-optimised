Introduction
Folklore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed childhood
through the ages, for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and
unreal. The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more
happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations.
Yet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be
classed as “historical” in the children’s library; for the time has
and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a

Having this thought in mind, the story of “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz”

Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and
did not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his
rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.

usual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at
the sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes.

From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry

and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down

The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the
air. Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.
The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the
of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles

It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy

Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore
round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with
little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The
hats of the men were blue; the little woman’s hat was white, and she
wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were
well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men,

She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the
scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its
head to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and

“Good day,” said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.



“I’m pretty well, thank you,” replied Dorothy politely. “How do you
do?”

“I’m not feeling well,” said the Scarecrow, with a smile, “for it is
very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.”

“No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away
the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.”
Dorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man
speak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.

yawned. “And where are you going?”

Toto did not like this addition to the party at first. He smelled
around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats
“Don’t mind Toto,” said Dorothy to her new friend. “He never bites.”

“Oh, I’m not afraid,” replied the Scarecrow. “He can’t hurt the straw.

So Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips
of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First

Then Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it

ground.

The great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him, and it
looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust. Its legs
were quite as long as the tiger had said, and its body covered with
coarse black hair. It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a

      It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in

      heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”


      “But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and
      Mr. Bennet made no answer.

      “Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife
      impatiently.

      This was invitation enough.

      “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is

      “Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?
      You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor

      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.

      “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
      persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
      neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is

      Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in
      Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,
      sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually
      giving offence.

      The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was
      stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as
      to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.
      there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had

      By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation
      at St. James’s had made him courteous.
      Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a

      _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton
      indeed not to discover it too.”

      “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you
      do.”

      much as she chooses.”

      “Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is

      and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had
      as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his
      character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a
      matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so

      an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.

      She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk
      to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother
      settled in London in a respectable line of trade.

      The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
      convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually

      were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the
      fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was
      worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an
      ensign.

      “I had much rather go in the coach.”

      “They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”

      She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the
      horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on
      horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many
      cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane
      had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were
      uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued

      “No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is
      nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back
      by dinner.”

      “I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but
      every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my
      opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is
      required.”

      Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young

      something better than politeness; there was good humour and
      all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy
      thinking only of his breakfast.

      Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.
      Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and
      not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken
      fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note

      When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and

      dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.”
      “_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley;

      could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort
      of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to

      “It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,”


      “I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a

      “That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed
      heartily.

      Bingley, “it would not make them one jot less agreeable.”

      To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it
      their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at

      Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and
      in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable
      answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr.

      elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this

      She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with
      some surprise at her silence.

      Bingley; “and pray what is the result?”


      “No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults
      called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.”

      “There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some
      particular evil—a natural defect, which not even the best

      In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth
      might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet,

      go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it
      would not be safe for her—that she was not enough recovered; but

      On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to
      almost all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth
      increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for
      pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn
      or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook
      the liveliest of spirits.

      military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances

      pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.”

      “Yes—the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of
      the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively
      attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to
      living fell, it was given elsewhere.”
      “Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How

      as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have
      doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to
      treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert
      that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance,
      hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less
      anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper,
      and I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
      very different sort of men, and that he hates me.”

      “Some time or other he _will_ be—but it shall not be by _me_.
      Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”

      Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him
      handsomer than ever as he expressed them.

      “But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive?
      What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?”
      “A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot
      but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy
      early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of
      often given me.”
      “I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never
      liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed
      suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such
      injustice, such inhumanity as this.”

      After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_
      remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the
      temper. His disposition must be dreadful.”
      “I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_
      Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,
      _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being
      amiable”—but she contented herself with, “and one, too, who had
      probably been his companion from childhood, connected together,
      as I think you said, in the closest manner!”
      greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the
      same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same
      parental care. _My_ father began life in the profession which
      gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted
      all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most
      highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential
      friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the

      very proud of what his father was—have done this. Not to appear
      or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful
      brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian
      most attentive and best of brothers.”

      He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me
      pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and
      education.”

      After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth
      could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:

      truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they

      “He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know

      “I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I

      and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to

      Longbourn House.

      light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite

      any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most
      intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.”

      “I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on,

      Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though
      she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could
      join in the evening’s amusement; and she was rather surprised to
      find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and
      was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop,
      or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.
      “I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a

      looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats

      the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained

      applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to

      would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to
      avoid a certain gentleman here.”

      less answerable for Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise
      had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former
      which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance,
      forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was
      resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned
      away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly
      provoked her.

      But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every
      prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not
      dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to
      two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were
      being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a
      of her release from him was ecstasy.

      She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of
      talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.
      When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and

      to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to
      console her:

      He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say
      “Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by

      that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.”

      “This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am
      to say. _You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.”

      He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone
      very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and,
      the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.”

      The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread

      “He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,” replied
      Elizabeth with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to

      lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”
      Sir William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him
      forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious
      and said, “Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we
      were talking of.”
      “I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not

      “What think you of books?” said he, smiling.

      recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit

      Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but

      “His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the
      same,” said Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him
      and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself.”

      “I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a

      warmly; “but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances

      dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the

      “Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it

      Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring
      introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment
      to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the
      of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking,
      replied thus:
      wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst
      the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me
      look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by
      your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant
      guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted
      watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very
      evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and
      “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see
      him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with
      time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr.
      Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and
      Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length
      slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to
      “I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied

      me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady
      Catherine’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a

      As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she
      Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her
      observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as
      Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the
      felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she
      felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to
      like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly saw
      were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near
      her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper,
      therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
      placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to
      find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas)
      freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane
      would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating
      charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from
      them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was
      and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
      she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her
      in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at
      her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to
      into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this

      find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She

      there was no chance of it.
      In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her
      less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she
      could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy,
      nonsensical.

      attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a

      silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was

      When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most
      pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at
      Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to
      next day for a short time.

      married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and
      with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the

      And upon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed
      looks, about to escape, she added: “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your
      staying and hearing Mr. Collins.”

      Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment’s
      began.

      she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to
      stop him further, and he continued:

      Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my
      power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can

      Collins very gravely—“but I cannot imagine that her ladyship
      would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I
      have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very
      qualification.”

      “Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You
      must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment
      of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and
      by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being

      reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to

      impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak

      was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would
      prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as to the loss of their
      society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in
      the enjoyment of his.

      “It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should
      not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.

      the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her,

      wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it

      Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward
      pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not

      always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was not exactly
      like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that,

      Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on

      daughter, to announce her engagement to the family. With many
      a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter—to an

      their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.
      Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so
      unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his
      account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte
      mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to

      expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins,
      Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal
      while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than
      her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she
      was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she
      trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,
      that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were
      cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been

      The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on
      Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the

      expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of

      pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much
      disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very strange
      that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it
      was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated
      and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were
      greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued absence.
      Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day
      after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him
      no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly

      happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she

      Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his
      reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been
      on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need
      much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of
      chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he
      sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology
      for his absence before the family went to bed.
      Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention
      of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of
      ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it
      successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous
      abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded

      talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
      and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were
      dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.

      should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take

      This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore,
      instead of making any answer, she went on as before.

      “Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such

      entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an

      “I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.

      Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very
      first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled
      Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the
      rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed
      Darcy’s praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions
      were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their
      increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment
      of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She

      she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had
      want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his
      to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness,
      however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to
      himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be
      else; and yet whether Bingley’s regard had really died away, or
      aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had escaped his
      situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.

      Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but

      no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
      acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or

      “To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no
      persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only
      think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My
      dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded,
      well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper
      way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte

      not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and

      “I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to
      design,” said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong, or to
      make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.

      “And do you impute it to either of those?”

      “Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by

      own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their
      brother’s. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it,
      they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make
      mistaken—or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison
      of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let

      Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.

      convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his
      transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but

      Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly
      acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to
      Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might
      be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the
      society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always

      the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible,

      much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she

      Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given
      before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with

      subject. “It seems likely to have been a desirable match for
      Jane,” said she. “I am sorry it went off. But these things happen
      accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort
      of inconsistencies are very frequent.”
      “An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth, “but it

      doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is
      as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour’s
      acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent
      was_ Mr. Bingley’s love?”

      “I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
      time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own
      ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to

      “And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of
      Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think
      Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month’s ablution
      enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter
      it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.”

      “So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does
      help calling.”
      “She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”
      But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to

      without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for
      the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not
      once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for
      home, some of the officers always made part of it—of which
      officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions,
      Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s warm
      them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their
      preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little
      uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject
      imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.

      To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
      unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years
      that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had,
      therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had
      been little there since the death of Darcy’s father, it was yet

      Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked

      with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.
      Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at
      length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even
      repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she “_wished_

      She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss
      Bingley. “I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words,

      every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last
      appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the

      longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister
      will prove what she felt.

      have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But,

      till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the
      pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not
      wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every
      advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because
      she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am
      not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know this anxiety to
      be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account

      fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have
      met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from

      Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it
      and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but
      slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing
      it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most

      twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and
      kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in
      bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.

      was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear,

      not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of

      Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to
      Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she
      health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant
      source of delight.
      When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye

      At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to
      the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house,
      herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her
      cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal
      civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some
      minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all
      out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as
      with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually

      comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of
      repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she
      could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.
      Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be
      ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily

      to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and
      Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features,

      neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss

      were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low
      voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing

      The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the
      servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had
      the bottom of the table, by her ladyship’s desire, and looked as
      and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was
      commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now
      enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a
      manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But
      Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration,

      Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time.
      de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing
      she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,
      and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.

      When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to
      poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great
      dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.
      Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
      knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very

      herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether

      trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very



      Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was
      long enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most
      comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and
      such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William
      was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out
      the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
      Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
      cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between
      the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather
      common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant
      aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason
      for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been

      two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had

      and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.
      Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in
      merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.

      Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
      time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his
      civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the
      health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and

      Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the
      Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably
      to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some

      little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had

      to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet
      several times, that she will never play really well unless she
      practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is
      very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every
      day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson’s room. She

      made no answer.

      “You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state
      so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to
      be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at
      every attempt to intimidate me.”

      “I shall not say you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you

      to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing
      opinions which in fact are not your own.”

      notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am
      particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose
      my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to
      pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it
      is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my

      perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is
      certainly a very good match for her.”
      “It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a
      distance of her own family and friends.”

      “An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”

      When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate
      employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had
      written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual
      every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which
      disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.
      Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of
      first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s shameful boast of what misery he had
      been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister’s
      sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to
      Rosings was to end on the day after the next—and, a still
      greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with
      that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had
      before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire
      his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered
      him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then
      getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but
      said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came
      “In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not
      be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire
      Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared,
      coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient
      encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long
      feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was
      not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His
      sense of her inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family
      obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on
      wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.
      In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be
      insensible to the compliment of such a man’s affection, and
      first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to
      resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in
      anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with
      spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer;
      acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see
      that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of
      apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real
      security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and,
      when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said:
      express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
      done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings
      which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of
      your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after
      and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He
      was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not
      open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The
      voice of forced calmness, he said:

      “I might as well enquire,” replied she, “why with so evident a

      indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that
      beloved sister?”
      As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the

      “And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the

      say—of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with
      the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your
      selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form

      could ever be prevailed on to marry.”

      shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane—his

      made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte’s

      herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her
      favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s sometimes
      coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she
      turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The
      park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon

      passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and
      every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was
      on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of
      directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near
      enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,
      pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself
      said, with a look of haughty composure, “I have been walking in
      the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me
      the honour of reading that letter?” And then, with a slight bow,

      With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest
      curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still
      increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of

      apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments

      and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been
      spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.

      off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my
      exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two

      weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that
      blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each

      watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging
      as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I
      remained convinced from the evening’s scrutiny, that though she
      received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by
      any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken
      your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have

      to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be

      disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what
      passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and
      every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to
      preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
      as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon
      returning.

      “The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters’
      of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time
      was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on
      joining him directly in London. We accordingly went—and there I
      readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the

      ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded

      with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great

      himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against

      for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in
      extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this
      concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however,
      I have not yet learnt to condemn them.

      the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has

      his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My

      profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it

      friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly

      legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long
      survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr.
      taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for
      the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some
      intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that
      the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient
      proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman;

      unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being
      ordained, if I would present him to the living in question—of
      which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well
      resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in
      proportion to the distress of his circumstances—and he was

      acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last

      latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of

      She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had
      sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and
      almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.
      Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she
      object; she could think only of her letter.

Chapter 37
      The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins
      as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone
      Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with

      them all to dine with her.
      Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,

      Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. “I
      assure you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I
      believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I
      am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be
      so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so
      till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,
      more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings
      certainly increases.”

      “Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I

      take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in

      object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.”

      Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a
      servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot
      bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.
      It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have
      the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young
      men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy,
      of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with
      propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to
      all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.

      insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane
      but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence, what
      irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always
      vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt
      with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they

      cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness
      of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the

      On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a
      few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the
      opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed
      indispensably necessary.

      I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our
      humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few
      domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford
      everything in our power to prevent your spending your time
      unpleasantly.”

      superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the
      frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may
      flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been
      entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine’s
      family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing
      while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”

      “You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into

      Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust
      it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but
      on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure
      cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte

      firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was
      not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by
      to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes

      housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent

      suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
      hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at

      kindness to you while you have been here.”

      shut, and the carriage drove off.

      “Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it
      things have happened!”

      “A great many indeed,” said her companion with a sigh.
      “We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there

      Bennet’s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in
      out of a dining-room up stairs. These two girls had been above an

      unconcern, “Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the
      shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim

      and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset

      “Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down
      at table. “What do you think? It is excellent news—capital

      Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told

      “Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You
      thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he
      often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is
      chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear
      imprudent as to fortune.”

      “But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said
      Jane.
      cared three straws about her—who _could_ about such a nasty
      little freckled thing?”

      Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
      coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the
      _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had harboured

      “How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia. “I am glad I
      and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear
      what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen
      any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes
      that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.
      married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to
      get husbands, you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have
      you; and then I would _chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear
      me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel
      the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was
      a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel
      well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or
      three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the
      then they soon found out what was the matter.”
      With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did
      Lydia, assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to
      amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened

      Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to
      see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner

      “Oh! Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had
      such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and
      pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone
      so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to
      the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and
      if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then

      But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to
      anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary
      at all.

      Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong
      sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear

      still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister’s
      refusal must have given him.

      must increase his disappointment!”

      “But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”



      She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents
      as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this
      for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world
      without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole
      consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour
      without involving the other.

      “This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to
      make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you
      It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from

      “I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham

      “There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of
      those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other
      all the appearance of it.”

      “And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a
      dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s
      One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but
      stumbling on something witty.”

      “Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say
      unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane
      and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!”

      acquaintances in general understand Wickham’s character.”
      Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can
      be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your
      opinion?”

      particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as
      possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to
      the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general

      may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present
      I will say nothing about it.”
      “You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin
      him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and
      desperate.”

      The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation.
      She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her
      whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was
      off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if

      “Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your opinion
      determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my
      sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane
      saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving
      young man—and I do not suppose there’s the least chance in the
      world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming

      Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and

      it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is
      an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her
      mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in
      “No, nothing at all.”
      “A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes.
      father is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say,
      whenever that happens.”

      they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be
      entailed on me.”




      The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began.
      dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were

      they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be
      smiling so, Lizzy?”
      Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered
      what she had herself endured on a similar occasion,
      five-and-twenty years ago.
      “I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when
      “I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.

      “If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.

      “Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
      disagreeable.”

      “A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.”

      imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the

      soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be
      that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in
      attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the
      ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off
      any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for
      comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,
      be often involved in the disgrace?”
      Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and
      affectionately taking her hand said in reply:
      “Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are
      known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear
      to less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three—very
      silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does
      not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a
      sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she

      They could have been understood only by her mother, who might

      consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband’s never
      intending to go there himself.
      Lydia’s leaving home.

      Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having
      was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality
      gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a
      sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to
      herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the
      inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which
      after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern
      for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such
      idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed
      it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing,
      that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had
      secured at any time by their renewal.

      gayer tone, “Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to
      hope,” he continued in a lower and more serious tone, “that he is
      improved in essentials.”

      While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
      rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a
      something in her countenance which made him listen with an

      that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but
      understood.”
      Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and
      agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off
      his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the

      he has very much at heart.”
      Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered

      Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she
      generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and
      illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all
      comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had
      brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the
      unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the
      country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his
      amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in
      general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of
      benefit from such as are given.
      Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of
      her father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with
      highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now
      a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising

      going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or
      satin curtains.

      Elizabeth said no more—but her mind could not acquiesce. The
      instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very
      idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt
      than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections;
      and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if
      her private enquiries to the absence of the family were
      unfavourably answered.

      Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
      of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family
      last question—and her alarms now being removed, she was at
      she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper
      scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.


      Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance
      they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.

      The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.

      It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising
      ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front,
      nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen
      a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty

      her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest
      for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she

      The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much
      well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after
      slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.
      The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving
      increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.
      Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the
      winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with
      delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were
      taking different positions; but from every window there were
      furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but
      Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither
      elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.

      With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!
      Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in
      them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and
      aunt. But no,”—recollecting herself—“that could never be; my
      uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been

      like regret.

      She longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master was

      Elizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.”
      “Yes, very handsome.”
      “I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up
      miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of


      Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy,
      drawn when she was only eight years old.
      “And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs.
      Gardiner.

      “Oh! yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
      accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long. In the next room
      is a new instrument just come down for her—a present from my
      master; she comes here to-morrow with him.”

      Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant,
      encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks;

      “Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend
      half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer

      “Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”

      “If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”
      “Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know
      who is good enough for him.”

      This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite
      firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed
      to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:
      “Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I

      “His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.

      “Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like
      more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She
      related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the
      merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.
      proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it
      is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.”
      “In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought
      “This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked,


      pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
      lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it
      was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a
      liking to the room when last at Pemberley.

      Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should
      “Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in
      a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her.”

      The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,
      were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good
      paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such
      as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to
      look at some drawings of Miss Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects
      were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.

      In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could
      in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.
      At last it arrested her—and she beheld a striking resemblance to
      minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and
      returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs.
      happiness were in his guardianship!—how much of pleasure or pain
      done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the
      housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood
      before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes
      upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment
      of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its
      As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth
      the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road,
      They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was
      his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their
      eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with
      immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced
      the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s
      have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to
      his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of
      his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered
      impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the
      few minutes in which they continued were some of the most
      uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease;
      he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left
      hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.

      At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a
      her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered
      by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate,
      in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come
      a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes
      sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his

      blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And

      thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was
      himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was

      the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many
      charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long
      park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant
      matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought
      them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to
      crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air
      of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet
      room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough
      windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived
      their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great
      walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the
      the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but
      engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in

      them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less
      sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before
      few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into
      some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk
      immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost
      none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she
      began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she
      had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when
      of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her

      her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was
      quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his
      against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself.
      “What will be his surprise,” thought she, “when he knows who they
      are? He takes them now for people of fashion.”

      That he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he
      sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going

      offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and
      most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with
      nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be

      can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_—it cannot be for _my_ sake
      After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the
      two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending
      originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the

      assured of his absence before she came to the place, and
      accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very
      unexpected—“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that
      you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed,
      acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”

      The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too
      great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She
      immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of
      being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,
      to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of
      her.
      They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.
      Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was

      Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.

      On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go
      and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy

      The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of
      them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they
      had expected. “He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and
      replied her aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not
      unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some
      people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it.”

      really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so
      cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not
      an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing
      laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose,
      Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in
      vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them
      to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what
      she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were
      capable of a very different construction; and that his character

      pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its
      environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by
      the morning’s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off
      again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was

      Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to
      visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was
      of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very

      newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation
      of Elizabeth’s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was
      quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of

      to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing

      such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made

      Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time
      to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when
      Bingley’s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he
      entered the room. All Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long
      done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood

      Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain
      own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter
      eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.
      In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister;
      talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased
      herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying
      recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of
      saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.
      it “was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing
      her;” and, before she could reply, he added, “It is above eight

      considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though
      favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.
      But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity;
      it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident
      that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had
      before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love
      with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify
      enquiry.

      Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it
      for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing
      of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and
      They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably
      had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants
      of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was
      good among the poor.

      ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so
      qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
      time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now
      so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all,
      goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude;
      gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving
      of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations

      of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.
      it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their
      side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to
      herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.

      Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme

      had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how
      unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was
      curious to know with how much civility on that lady’s side the
      acquaintance would now be renewed.
      saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.

      In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting
      there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom
      give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her
      being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however,
      did her justice, and pitied her.

      By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a
      curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such
      pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first
      broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman,
      her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the
      short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.

      have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they
      sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts
      gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the
      master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished
      this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley’s
      indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.

      The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
      the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till
      Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was
      now employment for the whole party—for though they could not all

      While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding
      whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.
      and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes
      to predominate, she began to regret that he came.

      other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had
      a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than
      a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the
      more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the
      came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so
      strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the smiles
      which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
      objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her
      brother’s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and
      likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first
      opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:

      “Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire Militia removed from
      Meryton? They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”

      thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave
      her a moment’s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel
      at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to

      ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s meditated elopement. To no
      creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except
      particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which
      hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and
      without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate
      him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something
      to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.
      Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his
      emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not
      approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time,
      her more and more cheerfully.

      Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
      above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their
      carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
      Elizabeth’s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not
      join her. Her brother’s recommendation was enough to ensure her
      finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy
      returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to
      him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.

      “How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,”
      is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and
      I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.”

      contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other

      doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”
      Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was
      walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow
      contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and
      instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; everything _must_

      the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to

      described as arising on a first interview with its object, and
      even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in

      expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this
      development. While the contents of the first letter remained in
      her mind, she was all surprise—all astonishment that Wickham
      should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for
      money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
      attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though
      difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her
      understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.
      She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire,
      that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that

      apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
      dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I
      know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But

      and address that can captivate a woman.”
      “But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very
      ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”

      such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane
      knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that

      curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.

      yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke
      of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality
      towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at
      liberty—which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about
      Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved,
      disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must

      related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our
      one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him
      should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that
      Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her
      in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such
      a consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was
      far enough from my thoughts.”

      It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could
      be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this
      interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could

      In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for

      was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general

      Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could

      The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the
      next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line
      they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude that he
      had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of _that_ they
      would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only
      for the letters before he set off.
      When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving
      Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his
      sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband’s

      serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs.
      Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of
      freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and
      always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening
      them up—though, as she never came without reporting some fresh
      instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom

      All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three
      months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared
      to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues,
      every tradesman’s family. Everybody declared that he was the
      wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out
      more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it,
      became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come

      Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife
      had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come
      to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and
      Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory
      information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the
      might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London,
      expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
      eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that
      Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London
      and promised to write again very soon. There was also a
      postscript to this effect:
      “I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
      possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,
      whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be

      to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give
      any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment

      years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in

      But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived
      which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for
      what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and
      read it likewise. It was as follows:
      “I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation

      Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer
      relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was
      certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintances
      had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did
      not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any
      of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as
      likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his
      own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in

      very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than
      a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at

      anxiety for his life had been before.
      “What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried.
      “Sure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is
      to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?”

      As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that
      she and the children should go to London, at the same time that
      Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the
      first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to

      Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and
      world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them
      by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.
      return that could come from Pemberley.
      The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse
      for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore,
      could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who
      could have borne the dread of Lydia’s infamy somewhat better. It

      “Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice

      greatness of mind.”

      They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her
      mother’s tea.

      deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of
      the paddock.
      Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
      Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for
      breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:
      “Oh, papa, what news—what news? Have you heard from my uncle?”

      “Yes I have had a letter from him by express.”

      “Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write

      case.”

      “Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble

      “I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”
      And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the

      be complied with.”

      “And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!”
      “Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But
      there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how
      much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the
      other, how am I ever to pay him.”
      “Money! My uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”

      “I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight

      went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the

      the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would

      “Just as you please.”
      “May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”
      “Take whatever you like, and get away.”

      up stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet:
      Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married, her joy burst
      been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter
      would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her
      felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.
      will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at
      Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write
      down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay,
      stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will
      put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we
      shall be together when we meet!”
      Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the
      violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the
      obligations which Mr. Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.
      “For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a
      pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.”
      “Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it
      my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the
      first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few
      presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a
      daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was
      that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you write
      for me. We will settle with your father about the money
      afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”
      She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,
      and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful
      orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her
      to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s
      delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother
      was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes,
      too, came into her head.

      am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here
      Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of
      punch to make merry at her wedding.”

      her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this

      Poor Lydia’s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it
      was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and
      though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor
      worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in
      looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she
      felt all the advantages of what they had gained.



      that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an
      annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his
      indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now
      be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of
      might then have rested in its proper place.
      He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to
      anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his
      brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out
      soon as he could.

      When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be
      perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The
      son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should
      be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means
      be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world,
      but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years
      after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he would. This event
      saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband’s
      love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
      income.
      to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in
      most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
      the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before
      daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to
      himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten
      for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual
      presents in money which passed to her through her mother’s hands,
      Lydia’s expenses had been very little within that sum.

      That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,
      too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present
      the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in
      seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former
      brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.

      change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery

      without knowing or considering what their income might be,

      it—or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger;

      What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that
      the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago,
      would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was
      as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex;
      She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
      disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding
      and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her
      both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been
      softened, his manners improved; and from his judgement,

      But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude
      what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different
      tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon
      to be formed in their family.

      How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable
      independence, she could not imagine. But how little of permanent

      and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her

      His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being
      admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,
      received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,
      and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by
      her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so
      mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as
      satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her
      the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore,
      he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that
      Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should
      consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own
      inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object
      of her wishes.
Chapter 51

      Their sister’s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt
      for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was
      sent to meet them at ——, and they were to return in it by

      receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the
      carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably
      Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown
      open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards,
      embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with
      an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and
      not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity;
      disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia
      still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned
      notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a

      “Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the
      breakfast room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a
      charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope
      they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton.
      That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we
      did not all go.”

      “Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I
      don’t at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”

      “Oh, lord! yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all
      things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.
      We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there
      will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for

      “And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my
      sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them

      One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with
      her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:

      “Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.
      You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.
      Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?”
      “No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too
      little said on the subject.”

      lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should
      all be there by eleven o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to
      go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well,
      you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I
      should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the
      longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.”

      “Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would

      were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But,
      prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy
      might have done as well.”

      “Oh, yes!—he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But
      gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word

      “If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the

      “we will ask you no questions.”

      “Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell

      On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out

      been at her sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly
      among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least
      temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and
      wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.
      Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the
      noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such

      possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she
      was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the
      benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter

      “My dear Niece,
      “I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
      morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing
      will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself

      professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that
      Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it
      private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for

      “There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago
      governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on
      some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She
      maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he
      knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for
      intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or

      to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
      friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
      offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found
      Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared
      for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not
      expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with
      Wickham, he easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He
      confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of
      folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and
      it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew

      The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of
      suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might
      have been doing to forward her sister’s match, which she had
      feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be
      probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain
      true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on
      himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a
      whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly
      checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her
      overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against
      of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure,
      of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been

      could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia,
      her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did she
      grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged,
      she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause

      “Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I
      thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.”
      “Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”
      “And do you like her?”

      “Very much.”
      “I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within
      this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very
      well.”

      They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked
      fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to
      provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:

      Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation

      pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.
      The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet

      circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders
      quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook
      her head by turns.

      “Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for
      Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the
      however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes
      it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that is nothing to us.
      You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word
      about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?”

      “You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was
      on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was
      likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcher’s, she told me,
      three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”

      Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without
      “I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the
      present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don’t
      moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at. I do assure
      pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we
      shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but
      I dread other people’s remarks.”

      in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming
      there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she
      still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the
      greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend’s
      permission, or being bold enough to come without it.

      cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without
      raising all this speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”

      In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be
      her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could
      easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were
      more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.

      Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
      husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that
      her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it,
      sister. “It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect
      indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually
      talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one
      can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be,
      when his stay at Netherfield is over!”
      “I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth;
      “but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the
      usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied
      me, because you have always so much.”
      Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of
      servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the
      period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as
      it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their

      Mrs. Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment
      towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she
      had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own

      She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without
      daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them

      door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than
      increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a

      Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and
      sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not
      often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He

      than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was

      mother, “I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you

      to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.”

      had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though
      not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should

      “You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for
      when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family
      dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you
      see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did
      not come back and keep your engagement.”


      Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and

      what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind; and she
      would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him

      entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the
      to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to
      their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure
      for the evening must depend.

      A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone.
      His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to

      with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed

      After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word
      passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went
      to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded,
      unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously,

      Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet
      spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was
      much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was
      nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his
      ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more

      turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it
      all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she thought
      was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
      Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who
      as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering
      would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged,

      sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But

      remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous
      neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an
      invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept.

      Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her
      sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow
      on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both
      In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth,
      for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone,

      The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be

      same by all her neighbours in Meryton.

      misfortune.



Chapter 56

      One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane
      had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting
      to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a
      morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to
      that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and
      neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded
      the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction,
      till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was

      They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
      inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.
      Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship’s
      Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of



      Catherine. “She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all
      is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds,
      in summer; the windows are full west.”



      from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her
      calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.

      Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take
      some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not
      “Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little
      turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.”
      “Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the
      different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”

      drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be

      gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to
      make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more
      than usually insolent and disagreeable.

      following manner:—
      “You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of
      my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell
      you why I come.”
      Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
      “Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to

      my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous

      “And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for

      all his family. You may have drawn him in.”

      as this, ever induce me to be explicit.”
      “Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the

      Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of
      carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not
      been used to submit to any person’s whims. I have not been in the

      “And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very
      well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet,

      “She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was
      Lizzy?”
      Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
      acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.



      Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this

      help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of
      her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to
      Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew;
      and how he might take a similar representation of the evils
      attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She

      instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,

      continued:

      “You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such
      matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to

      “Oh! yes. Pray read on.”

      condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it

      she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give

      To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as

      a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was

      Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend,
      as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to
      bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed
      before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his

      could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together.

      same.

      They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call
      general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him
      alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and,
      “Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of
      giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be

      to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to

      She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually
      all her former prejudices had been removed.

      “I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it
      one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your
      expressions which might justly make you hate me.”

      “When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself
      perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was
      written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.”
      feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it,
      are now so widely different from what they were then, that every

      told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information
      last spring?”


      but his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to
      confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended
      him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had
      purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am
      persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your

      “My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a
      question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she
      about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she
      of the truth.
      The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.
      The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged
      overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather
      _knew_ that she was happy than _felt_ herself to be so; for,
      besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils
      before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when
      her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him
      but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_
      At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very
      far from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely
      incredulous here.

      such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the
      last time I shall ever remember it myself.”

      Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
      seriously assured her of its truth.

      “Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself

      Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another,
      not to you.”
      Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been
      unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own
      now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia’s
      marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in

      am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?” Kitty
      owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great

      should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved
      whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome
      her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set
      against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain
      sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the
      disapprobation.

      she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on
      seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition,
      distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears
      and regrets in disposing of her—was a wretched reflection, and
      she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at

      “Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your
      senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”
      How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been
      more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have

      “Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the
      which he condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are
      neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your
      child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to
      respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.”

      really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change

      Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest

      her relations’ consent, there was still something to be wished

      to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that

      Elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted
      Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.
      “How could you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on
      words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in

      “Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no

      be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious
      consequence?”
      “My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could,
      whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or
      what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were

      “And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you
      and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady
      once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer
      neglected.”

      From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.
      Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.
      Gardiner’s long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate
      which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to
      find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of
      particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You
      greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a
      again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to
      wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round

      “Dear Sir,
      more to give.
      “Yours sincerely, etc.”

      Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
      marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote
      even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat
      all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but
      not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was
      deserved.

      The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar
      information, was as sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four

      reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine
      was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a

I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of

Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent

wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I

circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made
groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to
the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be
necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness
of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt
myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard
of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the
happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved

So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear
recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before
Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed
in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which
she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we

situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by

distant inequalities of the ice.

many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that
it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by
ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the
greatest attention.
About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before
rest for a few hours.
In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and
found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently
had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large
fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human
being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.
He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of
some undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the
master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish
on the open sea.”
On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a
foreign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he,

allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body

Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice

His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and

This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that
Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I
had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be
brought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to
announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as

been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have

The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and
her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her
feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in
innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by
thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have
excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the
imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She

Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed
gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the
the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair
despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within
me which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with

to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his
head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.
Our house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply
shaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and
desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all

journey. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and

At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded

I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside
the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that

A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,

learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By
degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I
was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled
me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now

they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the
minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,
and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in
every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and
the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible
objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the
mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having
discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of
discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and
_wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth
and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only
_Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot

born in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to

had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful
things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it

first analyzed it? Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the
strange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without
knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful

fascinating in this son of love and death.
Suddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses. He found that he had

Where he went to he hardly knew. He remembered wandering through dimly
houses. Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after
him. Drunkards had reeled by, cursing and chattering to themselves like
monstrous apes. He had seen grotesque children huddled upon door-steps,
and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.

As the dawn was just breaking, he found himself close to Covent Garden.

He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through. A dim sense

“It is an interesting question,” said Lord Henry, who found an
extremely interesting question. I fancy that the true explanation is
this: It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an
inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their
impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that. Sometimes,
however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses
our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply
appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are

passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies

A groan broke from Campbell’s lips and he shivered all over. The

As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray,
dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept
quietly out of his house. In Bond Street he found a hansom with a good

After a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being

them, were ranged round the walls. Greasy reflectors of ribbed tin

by a little charcoal stove, playing with bone counters and showing
their white teeth as they chattered. In one corner, with his head

The young Scotchman had just joined the guests. These, in addition to
the bow-window and its neighbourhood, included an inferior set at the

some of those personages who had stood outside the windows of the

back of the settle she decided that his statements showed him to be no
cordial and impassioned. She admired the serious light in which he
looked at serious things. He had seen no jest in ambiguities and
was none. She disliked those wretched humours of Christopher Coney and
his tribe; and he did not appreciate them. He seemed to feel exactly as
she felt about life and its surroundings—that they were a tragical
moments of gaiety were interludes, and no part of the actual drama. It
was extraordinary how similar their views were.

Though it was still early the young Scotchman expressed his wish to

mission, which was the act of a few moments only. When, candle in hand,
she reached the top of the stairs on her way down again, Mr. Farfrae

There was no more to be said, and the man came out, encountering
Elizabeth-Jane in his passage. She could see that his mouth twitched
with anger, and that bitter disappointment was written in his face

Elizabeth-Jane now entered, and stood before the master of the
premises. His dark pupils—which always seemed to have a red spark of
light in them, though this could hardly be a physical fact—turned
indifferently round under his dark brows until they rested on her
figure. “Now then, what is it, my young woman?” he said blandly.

Susan Henchard entered a carriage for the first time in her life when
she stepped into the plain brougham which drew up at the door on the
wedding-day to take her and Elizabeth-Jane to church. It was a windless
a powdery form on the nap of hats and coats. Few people had gathered
round the church door though they were well packed within. The

The position of Elizabeth-Jane’s room—rather high in the house, so that

walking together Henchard would lay his arm familiarly on his manager’s

Casterbridge, as has been hinted, was a place deposited in the block
upon a corn-field. There was no suburb in the modern sense, or
the wide fertile land adjoining, clean-cut and distinct, like a
chess-board on a green tablecloth. The farmer’s boy could sit under his
barley-mow and pitch a stone into the office-window of the town-clerk;
the pavement-corner; the red-robed judge, when he condemned a

wheat-ricks overhung the old Roman street, and thrust their eaves
against the church tower; green-thatched barns, with doorways as high
as the gates of Solomon’s temple, opened directly upon the main
thoroughfare. Barns indeed were so numerous as to alternate with every
half-dozen houses along the way. Here lived burgesses who daily walked

small farmers close at hand—and his waggons were often down that way.
One day, when arrangements were in progress for getting home corn from
one of the aforesaid farms, Elizabeth-Jane received a note by hand,
asking her to oblige the writer by coming at once to a granary on
high enough for persons to walk under. The gates were open, but nobody
was within. However, she entered and waited. Presently she saw a figure
meet him there alone, she quickly ascended the step-ladder leading to
the granary door, and entered it before he had seen her. Farfrae
advanced, imagining himself in solitude, and a few drops of rain
himself up to patience. He, too, was plainly expecting some one; could
it be herself? If so, why? In a few minutes he looked at his watch, and
then pulled out a note, a duplicate of the one she had herself
received.

This situation began to be very awkward, and the longer she waited the
more awkward it became. To emerge from a door just above his head and
descend the ladder, and show she had been in hiding there, would look
close beside her, and to relieve her suspense she gently moved the

“I wished to see you? O no—at least, that is, I am afraid there may be

“By no means.”
Acting on this consideration they lingered, Elizabeth-Jane’s face being
arranged to an expression of preternatural composure, and the young
Scot, at every footstep in the street without, looking from under the
granary to see if the passer were about to enter and declare himself
bottom; but nobody came, and the granary roof began to drip.
“The person is not likely to be coming,” said Farfrae. “It’s a trick

“It’s true, Miss Newson. We’ll hear news of this some day depend on’t,

“I don’t mind—much,” she replied.

“I only supposed you might be from the song you sang at the Three
Mariners—about Scotland and home, I mean—which you seemed to feel so

“Ay—and I did sing there—I did—— But, Miss Newson”—and Donald’s voice
became earnest—“it’s well you feel a song for a few minutes, and your
eyes they get quite tearful; but you finish it, and for all you felt
want to go back! Yet I’ll sing the song to you wi’ pleasure whenever
you like. I could sing it now, and not mind at all?”
“Thank you, indeed. But I fear I must go—rain or no.”

blowing her back hair, and her side hair, and her neck, and the crown
of her bonnet, and the fur of her victorine, Elizabeth saying, “O,
no manner of hurry to be gone.
She declined the offer, stepped out and was gone. Farfrae walked slowly
after, looking thoughtfully at her diminishing figure, and whistling in
undertones, “As I came down through Cannobie.”

At first Miss Newson’s budding beauty was not regarded with much
only one. The truth is that she was but a poor illustrative instance of

of ideas, and to have slight need for visible objects. She formed
curious resolves on checking gay fancies in the matter of clothes,
moment she had become possessed of money. But nothing is more insidious
indulgence she thought she would have such a bonnet. When she had a
with the bonnet. It was now absolutely necessary to finish; she ordered
the dress. In for a penny in for a pound; she bought the sunshade, and
the whole structure was at last complete.


But Donald Farfrae admired her, too; and altogether the time was an
exciting one; sex had never before asserted itself in her so strongly,
for in former days she had perhaps been too impersonally human to be
distinctively feminine. After an unprecedented success one day she came
forgetting the possible creasing and damage. “Good Heaven,” she
whispered, “can it be? Here am I setting up as the town beauty!”
When she had thought it over, her usual fear of exaggerating
appearances engendered a deep sadness. “There is something wrong in all
this,” she mused. “If they only knew what an unfinished girl I am—that

happen to-morrow.
Six o’clock struck, and there was no Whittle. At half-past six Henchard
entered the yard; the waggon was horsed that Abel was to accompany; and
the other man had been waiting twenty minutes. Then Henchard swore, and

Henchard went off, entered Abel’s house, a little cottage in Back
Street, the door of which was never locked because the inmates had
nothing to lose. Reaching Whittle’s bedside the corn-factor shouted a
bass note so vigorously that Abel started up instantly, and beholding
Henchard standing over him, was galvanized into spasmodic movements
which had not much relation to getting on his clothes.

“Out of bed, sir, and off to the granary, or you leave my employ
to-day! ’Tis to teach ye a lesson. March on; never mind your breeches!”
The unhappy Whittle threw on his sleeve waistcoat, and managed to get

“’Tis not tyrannical!” murmured Henchard, like a sullen boy. “It is to

During the day Farfrae learnt from the men that Henchard had kept

There came a shock which had been foreseen for some time by Elizabeth,
as the box passenger foresees the approaching jerk from some channel

Her mother was ill—too unwell to leave her room. Henchard, who treated
her kindly, except in moments of irritation, sent at once for the
richest, busiest doctor, whom he supposed to be the best. Bedtime came,
and they burnt a light all night. In a day or two she rallied.

Elizabeth, who had been staying up, did not appear at breakfast on the
letter for him from Jersey in a writing he knew too well, and had

near. Henchard was reading a letter from Lucetta, sent in answer to a
note from him, in which she made some excuse for not immediately
granting him a second interview that he had desired.

Donald had no wish to enter into conversation with his former friend on
their present constrained terms; neither would he pass him in scowling
who stood regarding him.
“Do you remember,” said Henchard, as if it were the presence of the
story of that second woman—who suffered for her thoughtless intimacy

“Well, ye owe her nothing more now,” said Farfrae heartily.

rattle of the yokes by which they carried off their evening supply.
“More bread-and-butter?” said Lucetta to Henchard and Farfrae equally,

old woman of mottled countenance, attired in a shawl of that nameless
worn in the country of the Psalmist where the clouds drop fatness; and
an apron that had been white in time so comparatively recent as still
to contrast visibly with the rest of her clothes. The steeped aspect of
the woman as a whole showed her to be no native of the country-side or
even of a country-town.

Henchard looked at her, with a momentary pause, as if she had reminded
quickly as it had come. “Well, and what has she been doing?” he said,
looking down at the charge sheet.

Still careful not to outrun the clerk’s penmanship Stubberd pulled up

In all the accounts which Henchard had given her of the separation from
his wife Susan for so many years, of his belief in her death, and so
on, he had never clearly explained the actual and immediate cause of
that separation. The story she now heard for the first time.

indoors she told her that she had resolved to go away from home to the
seaside for a few days—to Port-Bredy; Casterbridge was so gloomy.
Elizabeth, seeing that she looked wan and disturbed, encouraged her in
suspecting that the gloom which seemed to have come over Casterbridge
in Lucetta’s eyes might be partially owing to the fact that Farfrae was

The next day he called again. “Is she come now?” he asked.

After a few words, which only served to reveal his restless impatience,
Elizabeth had announced. That she had chosen for her afternoon walk the
road along which she had returned to Casterbridge three hours earlier
in a carriage was curious—if anything should be called curious in
accounting cause. It was the day of the chief market—Saturday—and
Farfrae for once had been missed from his corn-stand in the dealers’
room. Nevertheless, it was known that he would be home that night—“for
Sunday,” as Casterbridge expressed it.

shown some deference in his manner of approach; but no sooner did they

wildly, whereupon the bull advanced in a deliberate charge.

The barn stood behind a green slimy pond, and it was closed save as to
one of the usual pair of doors facing them, which had been propped open
by a hurdle-stick, and for this opening they made. The interior had
“We must climb up there,” she said.
But before they had even approached it they heard the bull scampering
through the pond without, and in a second he dashed into the barn,
knocking down the hurdle-stake in passing; the heavy door slammed
behind him; and all three were imprisoned in the barn together. The
pursuer was against the wall when the fugitives were already half way
on, the hot air from his nostrils blowing over them like a sirocco, and

adversary’s attention, and a man appeared. He ran forward towards the
leading-staff, seized it, and wrenched the animal’s head as if he would
snap it off. The wrench was in reality so violent that the thick neck

the nose dropped blood. The premeditated human contrivance of the
nose-ring was too cunning for impulsive brute force, and the creature

Elizabeth soon found the muff, such an article being by no means small

intended a practical joke than a murder. Henchard had secured him by

it would be best not to intrude on the other two just now. Henchard had
saved Lucetta, and to provoke a possible exhibition of her deeper
affection for himself was as ungenerous as it was unwise.
The immediate subject of their talk being exhausted she felt more
embarrassed at sitting thus beside her past lover; but soon the two
figures of the others were visible at the entrance to the town. The

house he found her there.

His heart was so exacerbated at parting from the girl that he could not

before he left her she had said that for him to be absent from her
wedding was not as she wished it to be.
The remembrance would continually revive in him now that it was not
Elizabeth and Farfrae who had driven him away from them, but his own
haughty sense that his presence was no longer desired. He had assumed

proof whatever that if he did return he would stay. What if he had been

The possibility led them to alight, and at least make an inquiry at the
years of rain-washings to a lumpy crumbling surface, channelled and
leafy strap of ivy which could scarcely find substance enough for the
doorway, and lay there undisturbed. The door was ajar; Farfrae knocked;
and he who stood before them was Whittle, as they had conjectured.

His face showed marks of deep sadness, his eyes lighting on them with
an unfocused gaze; and he still held in his hand the few sticks he had
been out to gather. As soon as he recognized them he started.

he died. One of the neighbours have gone to get a man to measure him.”

“Upon the head of his bed he pinned a piece of paper, with some writing
upon it,” continued Abel Whittle. “But not being a man o’ letters, I

They stood in silence while he ran into the cottage; returning in a
moment with a crumpled scrap of paper. On it there was pencilled as

that he was my own uncle—my mother’s brother—that he had taken me when
a parentless infant to his house; and that in his last moments he had

The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had
a frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare,
crossed with thick black bars. I heard voices, too, speaking with a
hollow sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my

a state that no calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them
agreeably.

Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a
tart on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir
in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had

Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to
go and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not
money she thus obtained. She had a turn for traffic, and a marked

she first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old
curl-paper; but some of these hoards having been discovered by the
housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her valued treasure,
consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious rate of
interest—fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted every

The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with

who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed,

Business now began: the day’s Collect was repeated, then certain texts

was terminated, day had fully dawned. The indefatigable bell now
sounded for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched
into another room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of
getting something to eat! I was now nearly sick from inanition, having

were now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
encountered the personage who had received me last night. She stood at
her answer, went back to her place, and said aloud—

While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
up the room. I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her
steps. Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely;

The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
sank at her voice. She went on—

“It is to be done on my responsibility,” she added, in an explanatory
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.

The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze. I was similarly
equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.

But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
house. The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more

apportioned to each pupil. I ate what I could, and wondered within
myself whether every day’s fare would be like this.

The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with
whom I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss
ignominious, especially for so great a girl—she looked thirteen or
grave, she stood, the central mark of all eyes. “How can she bear it so
to me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up. She looks as
if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment—beyond her
situation: of something not round her nor before her. I have heard of
day-dreams—is she in a day-dream now? Her eyes are fixed on the floor,
at what is really present. I wonder what sort of a girl she is—whether
good or naughty.”

Soon after five P.M. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more—I
was still hungry. Half-an-hour’s recreation succeeded, then study; then
the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed. Such
was my first day at Lowood.



The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;
washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen. A change had taken place
in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,

I felt ready to perish with cold. Breakfast-time came at last, and this
morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the
quantity small. How small my portion seemed! I wished it had been
an actor therein. At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart,
from task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
o’clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of

A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
girls examined. The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and
little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her
memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and
she was ready with answers on every point. I kept expecting that Miss

morning!”
Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.

My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a

the small inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a
minute, carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one
respectful curtesy; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed
her pinafore, and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her
neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to Burns’

“Hardened girl!” exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; “nothing can correct you of

Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the

“Now,” thought I, “I can perhaps get her to talk.” I sat down by her on
the floor.

“Helen.”

“Do you come a long way from here?”
“I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland.”
“I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future.”

“You must wish to leave Lowood?”

“No! why should I? I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it

One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,

stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from
architecture. Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in

for the “Coming Man,” whose information respecting my past life and

Mr. Brocklehurst again paused—perhaps overcome by his feelings. Miss
Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor’s
severity.
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands
behind his back, majestically surveyed the whole school. Suddenly his
eye gave a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or
shocked its pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had

Ere the half-hour ended, five o’clock struck; school was dismissed, and
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor. The
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
sank prostrate with my face to the ground. Now I wept: Helen Burns was

done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I

told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.

discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.


Barbara went out: she returned soon—

Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
Brocklehurst’s own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.

Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before
each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast,
she got up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in

be able to pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation. The
teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of

I was passing the back-parlour or teachers’ sitting-room, the door of

I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and
lively complexion.
“Well, who is it?” she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half
recognised; “you’ve not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?”
In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: “Bessie!
Bessie! Bessie!” that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half
cried, and we both went into the parlour. By the fire stood a little
fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.

“Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I’ve

Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was

by the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable
magnitude, much larger than Lowton. We were now, as far as I could see,
on a sort of common; but there were houses scattered all over the

stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants

The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer

child, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes
wayward; but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no
injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for

two-leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate,
draperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance. It
revealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it,

“Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?”
“Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice.”
Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated
the news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with
Mr. Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I
went upstairs to take off my things.

“Oh, at six o’clock: he keeps early hours in the country. You had

“Is it necessary to change my frock?”

“Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
is here.”

This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired
to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax’s aid, replaced my black stuff dress
by one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had,

Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot—Adèle knelt
near him. Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adèle and the dog: the fire
shone full on his face. I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
his black hair. I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw—yes, all three were very grim, and no
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the

Adèle wondering whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for,
owing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed. She was

it seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.

We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been

balcony. It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and

wonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it
for the present inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my

not, for he brought them frequently before me. He was proud, sardonic,

his head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose,

I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward

that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester

could not be admitted. “Yet,” I reflected, “she has been young once;
her youth would be contemporary with her master’s: Mrs. Fairfax told me

A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and
still he did not come. Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if
he were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the

scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,
such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors
and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
Adèle ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company
She would have Sophie to look over all her “toilettes,” as she called
the new. For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front
chambers, jump on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and
chimneys. From school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had

The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for
dinner at six. During the intervening period I had no time to nurse

folds, and gleaming through them, shone rich raven ringlets.

The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the
angle of the house, and I lost sight of it. Adèle now petitioned to go
down; but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she
must not on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies,

Rochester would be very angry, &c. “Some natural tears she shed” on

ladies’ silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and

chimney-corner. She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a
broad-brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under
her chin. An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending

I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire. I felt now as
looked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as
she raised it, that it was a strange one. It looked all brown and
under her chin, and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye
confronted me at once, with a bold and direct gaze.

yearning to forget and forgive all injuries—to be reconciled and clasp
hands in amity.

One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to

prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with

scarcely cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm;

I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy. The

precisely what I wished—he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany

And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising
calm before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy

“The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment.”
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did
the same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled
under his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or
eyes, he said, “Proceed.”
Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
intonation. Presently Mr. Wood said—
“I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been
asserted, and evidence of its truth or falsehood.”
“The ceremony is quite broken off,” subjoined the voice behind us. “I
am in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to
this marriage exists.”

Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid,
making no movement but to possess himself of my hand. What a hot and
strong grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm,

What unutterable pathos was in his voice! How hard it was to reiterate

once quitted the room.


That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon
as I lay down in bed. I was transported in thought to the scenes of
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears. The light that long
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed
anticipation; as though some word of doom were to be written on her
earthward. It gazed and gazed on me. It spoke to my spirit:
immeasurably distant was the tone, yet so near, it whispered in my
heart—

wheels to the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up

delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had
made. I had previously taken a journey to S—— to purchase some new
furniture: my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what
were: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing
again the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the
spectacle of the smartest innovations. Still some novelty was
to be invested. Dark handsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement
of some carefully selected antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze,
answered the end: they looked fresh without being glaring. A spare
parlour and bedroom I refurnished entirely, with old mahogany and
crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the passage, and carpets on the
stairs. When all was finished, I thought Moor House as complete a model

the accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee
of reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come. In
the very meridian of the night’s enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a

“It would do,” I affirmed with some disdain, “perfectly well. I have a
comrade’s constancy; a fellow-soldier’s frankness, fidelity,

But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
to hear them uttered. As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an
austere and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
submission—the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has

and placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he
had nothing to forgive, not having been offended.





CHAPTER XXXV
He deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me
feel what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet
implacable man can inflict on one who has offended him. Without one
overt act of hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me

that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in
his power to do so. Both by nature and principle, he was superior to
me and him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and
He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian,
spirit of interest and approval which had formerly communicated a
certain austere charm to his language and manner. To me, he was in
reality become no longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright,
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which
harassed and crushed me altogether. I felt how—if I were his wife, this
good man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without
drawing from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own
metal. To his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as
completely I was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast;

The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the
garden about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this

little gate; I spoke to the point at once.

This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
enough. Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should

The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
crash down.
“Once more, why this refusal?” he asked.

“Now you will indeed hate me,” I said. “It is useless to attempt to
conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you.”
A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched
on the truth. That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm. I knew
the steely ire I had whetted. I was heart-wrung.

“I have no intention to grieve or pain you—indeed, I have not.”
Most bitterly he smiled—most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
“And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
presume?” said he, after a considerable pause.


Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams

than by leaving it.”
“What do you mean?”


“I know where your heart turns and to what it clings. The interest you

“Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?”
“I must find out what is become of him.”

there is something the matter. Tell me what business St. John and you

impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during
the hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts,
you force yourself to perform. I am astonished you found courage to
refuse his hand. You do not love him then, Jane?”

“Not as a husband.”

“Yet he is a handsome fellow.”

“Plain! You? Not at all. You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
to be grilled alive in Calcutta.” And again she earnestly conjured me
to give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
“I must indeed,” I said; “for when just now I repeated the offer of
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to
find in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such.”

“What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?”

“You should hear himself on the subject. He has again and again

I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me. It
was _my_ time to assume ascendency. _My_ powers were in play and in
force. I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
me: I must and would be alone. He obeyed at once. Where there is energy
to command well enough, obedience never fails. I mounted to my chamber;

The daylight came. I rose at dawn. I busied myself for an hour or two
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the

door. I took it up. It bore these words—
“You left me too suddenly last night. Had you stayed but a little
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian’s cross and the
day fortnight. Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into
temptation: the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is
weak. I shall pray for you hourly.—Yours, ST. JOHN.”

“My spirit,” I answered mentally, “is willing to do what is right; and
strong enough to search—inquire—to grope an outlet from this cloud of
doubt, and find the open day of certainty.”

took the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross—there
thought I: “I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross. I too have some to
see and ask after in England, before I depart for ever.”
It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. I filled the interval in

wondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the
foundations of Paul and Silas’s prison; it had opened the doors of the

At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
and should be absent at least four days.

“Alone, Jane?” they asked.
“Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
time been uneasy.”

They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
often said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained
from comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well
nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
inquiries—no surmises. Having once explained to them that I could not

I left Moor House at three o’clock P.M., and soon after four I stood at

those solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great

It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours. I had set out from Whitcross
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning
the coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the
midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral
hills (how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern
North-Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a
once familiar face. Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was
sure we were near my bourne.
“How far is Thornfield Hall from here?” I asked of the ostler.
“Just two miles, ma’am, across the fields.”
“My journey is closed,” I thought to myself. I got out of the coach,
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the
brightening day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt
letters, “The Rochester Arms.” My heart leapt up: I was already on my
master’s very lands. It fell again: the thought struck it:—

I wonder what they thought. They must have considered I was very
careful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and
reckless. A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my

“What affectation of diffidence was this at first?” they might have
demanded; “what stupid regardlessness now?”

He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards
the grass-plat. Where was his daring stride now? Then he paused, as if

“Let me alone,” was the answer.
John withdrew without having observed me. Mr. Rochester now tried to
walk about: vainly,—all was too uncertain. He groped his way back to

and arranged Indian battles. He and his fat young brother Leo, the
idler, held the loft of the stable while we tried to carry it by storm;

eight years had brought. The friend whom he had known under a shabby

Kearney began to be heard often on people’s lips. People said that she
was very clever at music and a very nice girl and, moreover, that she
was a believer in the language movement. Mrs Kearney was well content
to her and proposed that her daughter should be the accompanist at a
enterprise, advised and dissuaded; and finally a contract was drawn up
him. She had tact. She knew what _artistes_ should go into capitals and
what _artistes_ should go into small type. She knew that the first
tenor would not like to come on after Mr Meade’s comic turn. To keep
the audience continually diverted she slipped the doubtful items in

men, wearing bright blue badges in their coats, stood idle in the

secretary of the Society, Mr Fitzpatrick. She smiled and shook his
hand. He was a little man, with a white vacant face. She noticed that
his accent was flat. He held a programme in his hand and, while he was
talking to her, he chewed one end of it into a moist pulp. He seemed to
bear disappointments lightly. Mr Holohan came into the dressing-room

Mrs Kearney rewarded his very flat final syllable with a quick stare of
contempt, and then said to her daughter encouragingly:

Mr Holohan admitted that the _artistes_ were no good but the Committee,

hour before the time at which the concert was to begin. By ill luck it
was a rainy evening. Mrs Kearney placed her daughter’s clothes and
music in charge of her husband and went all over the building looking
for Mr Holohan or Mr Fitzpatrick. She could find neither. She asked the
deal of trouble, a steward brought out a little woman named Miss Beirne
to whom Mrs Kearney explained that she wanted to see one of the
secretaries. Miss Beirne expected them any minute and asked could she

Mrs Kearney had to go back to the dressing-room.

The _artistes_ were arriving. The bass and the second tenor had already
come. The bass, Mr Duggan, was a slender young man with a scattered
city and, as a boy, he had sung prolonged bass notes in the resounding
hall. From this humble state he had raised himself until he had become
king in the opera of _Maritana_ at the Queen’s Theatre. He sang his
music with great feeling and volume and was warmly welcomed by the
his nose in his gloved hand once or twice out of thoughtlessness. He
passed unnoticed and he never drank anything stronger than milk for his
voice’s sake. Mr Bell, the second tenor, was a fair-haired little man
who competed every year for prizes at the Feis Ceoil. On his fourth
trial he had been awarded a bronze medal. He was extremely nervous and
extremely jealous of other tenors and he covered his nervous jealousy
with an ebullient friendliness. It was his humour to have people know
what an ordeal a concert was to him. Therefore when he saw Mr Duggan he
went over to him and asked:

“Yes,” said Mr Duggan.

Mr Bell laughed at his fellow-sufferer, held out his hand and said:

Mrs Kearney passed by these two young men and went to the edge of the

her husband privately. Their conversation was evidently about Kathleen

that moment and the two young ladies asked him who was the unknown
woman. Mr Holohan said that she was Madam Glynn from London. Madam
Glynn took her stand in a corner of the room, holding a roll of music
stiffly before her and from time to time changing the direction of her
startled gaze. The shadow took her faded dress into shelter but fell
revengefully into the little cup behind her collar-bone. The noise of
the hall became more audible. The first tenor and the baritone arrived

When she came back to the dressing-room her cheeks were slightly
suffused. The room was lively. Two men in outdoor dress had taken
possession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with Miss

laughing. He was old enough to suspect one reason for her politeness

beneath him rose and fell at that moment for him, that the laughter and
fragrance and wilful glances were his tribute. When he could stay no

came sounds of encouragement, clapping and stamping of feet. The first
tenor and the baritone and Miss Healy stood together, waiting
tranquilly, but Mr Bell’s nerves were greatly agitated because he was
afraid the audience would think that he had come late.
Mr Holohan and Mr O’Madden Burke came into the room. In a moment Mr
Holohan perceived the hush. He went over to Mrs Kearney and spoke with
her earnestly. While they were speaking the noise in the hall grew
louder. Mr Holohan became very red and excited. He spoke volubly, but
Mrs Kearney said curtly at intervals:

Mr Holohan pointed desperately towards the hall where the audience was
clapping and stamping. He appealed to Mr Kearney and to Kathleen. But
Mr Kearney continued to stroke his beard and Kathleen looked down,
repeated:

“She won’t go on without her money.”

After a swift struggle of tongues Mr Holohan hobbled out in haste. The
room was silent. When the strain of the silence had become somewhat

After that Mrs Kearney’s conduct was condemned on all hands: everyone
aside to allow the baritone and his accompanist to pass up to the
platform. She stood still for an instant like an angry stone image and,
when the first notes of the song struck her ear, she caught up her
daughter’s cloak and said to her husband:

“Get a cab!”
He went out at once. Mrs Kearney wrapped the cloak round her daughter
“I’m not done with you yet,” she said.
Kathleen followed her mother meekly. Mr Holohan began to pace up and
down the room, in order to cool himself for he felt his skin on fire.


Two gentlemen who were in the lavatory at the time tried to lift him
up: but he was quite helpless. He lay curled up at the foot of the
stairs down which he had fallen. They succeeded in turning him over.
His hat had rolled a few yards away and his clothes were smeared with
His eyes were closed and he breathed with a grunting noise. A thin
stream of blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.

These two gentlemen and one of the curates carried him up the stairs
and laid him down again on the floor of the bar. In two minutes he was
surrounded by a ring of men. The manager of the bar asked everyone who
he was and who was with him. No one knew who he was but one of the
curates said he had served the gentleman with a small rum.
“No, sir. There was two gentlemen with him.”

The ring of onlookers distended and closed again elastically. A dark
medal of blood had formed itself near the man’s head on the tessellated

“We can meet at half-seven,” said Mr M’Coy.

“No, no,” said Mr Cunningham in an evasive tone, “it’s just a little

The inference was allowed. Mr Cunningham continued.
“He had a strong face,” said Mr Kernan.
“Is that so?” said Mr Fogarty.

Mr M’Coy tasted his whisky contentedly and shook his head with a double

slipped with a squeaking noise through the snow-stiffened frieze, a
cold, fragrant air from out-of-doors escaped from crevices and folds.

She had preceded him into the pantry to help him off with his overcoat.
Gabriel smiled at the three syllables she had given his surname and
glanced at her. She was a slim, growing girl, pale in complexion and
paler. Gabriel had known her when she was a child and used to sit on

It had cast a gloom over him which he tried to dispel by arranging his
cuffs and the bows of his tie. He then took from his waistcoat pocket a
little paper and glanced at the headings he had made for his speech. He
was undecided about the lines from Robert Browning for he feared they

Gabriel laughed nervously and patted his tie reassuringly while Aunt

smile soon faded from Aunt Julia’s face and her mirthless eyes were
directed towards her nephew’s face. After a pause she asked:
“And what are goloshes, Gabriel?”

assumed a very low Dublin accent so that the young ladies, with one
instinct, received his speech in silence. Miss Furlong, who was one of

Julia, who was carrying in a column of table-napkins, turned to her
sister and said, simply, as if the question had surprised her:

“It’s only Freddy, Kate, and Gabriel with him.”
In fact right behind her Gabriel could be seen piloting Freddy Malins
across the landing. The latter, a young man of about forty, was of
Gabriel’s size and build, with very round shoulders. His face was
fleshy and pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes
of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had coarse features,

“There was no row,” said Gabriel moodily, “only she wanted me to go for

“You can go if you like,” said Gabriel coldly.
She looked at him for a moment, then turned to Mrs Malins and said:

there stood, as sentries to a fruit-stand which upheld a pyramid of
oranges and American apples, two squat old-fashioned decanters of cut

picture of her, somewhere before.

ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable

endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.
J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and
gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face,
but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass
over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set
them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then
sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved

We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.
There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing
young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples
holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the
corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individually or
relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the
traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had

slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying

Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler
hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him
on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of
us in turn.
When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure
her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid
and corpulent person in his middle years.

“Who is he?” I demanded. “Do you know?”

“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”

“Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile.

They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”

There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra

“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are

The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it
began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and
looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin
was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as
though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about
him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him
off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as
the fraternal hilarity increased. When the “Jazz History of the World”
was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a
puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into
Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s

intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which
overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now
implored me to join him, I went inside.
The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was
on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and

I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights

At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car

As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took
hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned
toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most,
over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.

just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be
likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.

For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of
days. He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became
contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of
the others because they were hysterical about things which in his
overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted.
But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque

not going to take care of her any more.”


“I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.
“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.
“Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he

has its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments

clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the

voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his

“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing we can

A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision.
As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of
the situation in a few brisk phrases.

against Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played
out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without
reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.

She was the first “nice” girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed
capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with
intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her
as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,
a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other
bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its
corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already
in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s
shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely
withered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved
Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all

But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal
accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was
at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the

I didn’t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have

room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his

It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of

It was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the
porch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there
was an autumn flavour in the air. The gardener, the last one of
Gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the steps.

“I’m going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves’ll start
falling pretty soon, and then there’s always trouble with the pipes.”

I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already
too far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that

distortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic
dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at
