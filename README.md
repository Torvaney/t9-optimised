# Optimising the T9 keyboard

* Rearranging the characters on a T9-style keyboard can reduce the number keystrokes per character typed (i.e. increase the typing efficiency of the keyboard)
* The improvement is enough for a 6-key layout to achieve similar efficiency to the standard T9 keyboard (8 keys)
