# Optimising the T9 keyboard

* Rearranging the characters on a T9-style keyboard can reduce the number keystrokes per character typed (i.e. increase the typing efficiency of the keyboard)
* The improvement is enough for a 6-key layout to achieve similar efficiency to the standard T9 keyboard (8 keys)

The write-up for this project can be found here: https://torvaney.github.io/projects/t9-optimised

## Running the optimiser

* Run the optimiser with `python src/main.py`.
* View results in `data/results.json` and optimised keyboards in `images/...`

Train and test data has been included in `data/`. To run the optimiser on different text, simply change these files.
